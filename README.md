# sts-ram-saver
ram saving mod for slay the spire

reduces ram consumption of Slay the Spire mods by managing all created textures, avoiding keeping them all loaded (common practice due to being how the base game handles things, keeping things loaded instead of managing most textures)

loads textures when needed, disposes of them when not in use
